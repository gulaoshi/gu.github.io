Which of the following does NOT describe [Rossbach11], "Rossbach, PTask: Operating System Abstractions To Manage GPUs as Compute Devices"?
A. to provide a dataflow programming model for GPU.
B. to reduce unnecessary memory transfers between CPU and GPU.

In [Kim14] "GPUnet: Networking Abstractions for GPU Programs", RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is used to:
A. perform memory transfers between CPU and GPU
B. offload transport layer processing to NIC (Network Interface Card)
C. maintain cache coherence between CPU and GPU
D. reduce unnecessary memory transfers between CPU and GPU.

ANS: ________________
B

Cache coherence protocols are used to:
A. lock cache lines so they are not pushed out to memory
B. keep data consistent across multiple private caches on a multicore processor
C. implement virtual memory on a multicore processor
D. perform cache partitioning to give each application its own private cache space and avoid cache contention on a multicore processor.
